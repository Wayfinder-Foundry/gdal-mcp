## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Geospatial Reasoning Substrate

This release transforms gdal-mcp from a tool wrapper into a **geospatial reasoning substrate** that enables models to compose GDAL operations with domain understanding, justified decisions, and persistent context.

### Added

#### Reflection Preflight System
- **Pre-execution reasoning prompts** for consequential geospatial operations
- **Justification schema** with intent, alternatives, choice, and confidence levels
- **Disk-based reflection store** with domain-aware caching and atomic writes
- **Decorator-based middleware** for seamless tool integration (`@requires_reflection`)
- **Risk classification framework** for operation consequence assessment

#### Domain-Aware Prompts
- **CRS selection reasoning** - Distance/area/shape preservation analysis
- **Resampling method justification** - Signal property preservation logic
- **Hydrology conditioning rationale** - Flow path preservation reasoning
- **Aggregation statistic reasoning** - Interpretation goal analysis
- **Prompt registration system** - LLM-driven reasoning infrastructure

#### Architecture & Infrastructure
- **Middleware layer** for cross-cutting concerns (preflight, reflection store)
- **Resource-based reference data** for static/semi-static geospatial knowledge
- **Agent guidelines** (AGENTS.md) with tool affordance index and work mode classification
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 72 passing tests with full coverage
- **Type safety** - Full mypy strict mode compliance across reflection system

### Changed
- **Reorganized middleware** - Moved from single file to dedicated module
- **Enhanced error handling** - Proper exception chaining with `from exc`
- **Updated agent guidelines** - Trust-based approach enabling emergent workflows
- **Improved documentation** - Updated README with v1.0.0 features and vision

### Technical Details
- Python 3.11+ required
- FastMCP 2.0 integration
- Pydantic 2.0+ for type-safe models
- Ruff linting and mypy strict mode compliance
- Atomic file operations for crash safety

### Philosophy
This release establishes the foundation for **geospatial reasoning**: models can now compose GDAL operations with domain understanding, justified decisions, and persistent context - enabling discovery of novel analysis workflows beyond prescribed procedures.
