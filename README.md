## üß† The Reflection System

### What Makes GDAL MCP Different?

Most AI tool systems execute operations immediately when requested. GDAL MCP requires the AI to **justify methodological decisions** before execution, creating a conversation about the "why" rather than just executing the "what."

**Traditional AI tool approach:**
```
User: "Reproject this DEM to Web Mercator"
AI: *silently executes operation*
Result: DEM reprojected (but with what resampling? why that CRS? what tradeoffs?)
```

**GDAL MCP with reflection:**
```
User: "Reproject this DEM to Web Mercator for my web map"
AI: *reflection middleware intercepts*
AI: "Before reprojecting to EPSG:3857, let me justify this CRS choice:
     
     Intent: Web Mercator preserves angles (conformal projection),
             essential for web tile rendering and navigation
     
     Alternatives considered:
     - EPSG:4326 (WGS84) ‚Üí rejected: not conformal, distorts shapes
     - Local UTM ‚Üí rejected: limited extent, not web-standard
     
     Tradeoffs: Area distortion increases at high latitudes
                (acceptable for web visualization)
     
     Confidence: High - this is the standard for web mapping"

*justification stored, operation proceeds*
Result: DEM reprojected with documented methodology
```

### Why This Matters

**1. Utilizes Full MCP Protocol Capabilities**

The Model Context Protocol isn't just about tool execution‚Äîit's about **agentic reasoning and interaction**. The reflection system leverages MCP's design to enable:
- Pre-execution prompting (tool dependencies)
- Structured reasoning (schema-validated justifications)
- Stateful workflows (justification caching)
- Human-in-the-loop interaction (advisory prompts)

**2. Prevents Silent Failures**

Geospatial operations can execute successfully while producing **methodologically incorrect results**:
- Nearest-neighbor resampling on continuous elevation data (creates artifacts)
- Web Mercator for area calculations (40%+ distortion possible)
- Bilinear interpolation on categorical data (creates invalid class values)

The reflection system **surfaces these choices** for validation.

**3. Educational, Not Restrictive**

The AI isn't blocked from executing operations‚Äîit's **required to demonstrate understanding**:
- First use: Explains reasoning, teaches methodology
- Cached: Instant execution (knowledge persists)
- Result: 75%+ cache hit rates, minimal friction

**4. Creates Audit Trail**

Every methodological decision is documented with:
- Intent (what property must be preserved?)
- Alternatives (what else was considered?)
- Rationale (why this choice?)
- Tradeoffs (what are the limitations?)
- Confidence (high/medium/low)

This enables **reproducible geospatial science**.

## üéØ Example Workflow

### Multi-Operation Geospatial Analysis

```
User: "I need to reproject this DEM to UTM for accurate slope analysis,
       then reproject this vector layer to the same CRS for overlay"

AI Workflow:
1. Inspects DEM metadata (raster_info)
2. REFLECTION: Justifies UTM Zone 10N choice (accurate distance/area)
3. REFLECTION: Justifies cubic resampling (smooth gradients for derivatives)
4. Reprojects DEM (raster_reproject)
5. Inspects vector metadata (vector_info)
6. CACHE HIT: Reuses UTM justification (cross-domain!)
7. Reprojects vector (vector_reproject) - instant, no re-prompting
8. Both datasets now aligned in UTM Zone 10N

Result: 2 operations, 2 reflections (not 3!)
Cache hit rate: 50% ‚Üí Saves time, maintains methodology
```

**The Key Innovation:** The CRS justification from step 2 is reused in step 6 because the methodology (why UTM Zone 10N?) is **domain-based, not tool-based**. It doesn't matter if you're working with raster or vector data‚Äîthe projection choice reasoning is the same.

See **[Tools Reference](TOOLS.md)** for detailed examples of all available tools.

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdal-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "gdal-mcp", "gdal", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "env": {
