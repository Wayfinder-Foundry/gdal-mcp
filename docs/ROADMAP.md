## ðŸš§ Active Development

### v1.0.1 â€” Advisory Prompting Pattern (Released 2025-10-26) âœ…
- âœ… All reflection prompts updated to advisory tone
- âœ… Conversational intervention over blocking
- âœ… Educational design principle documented
- âœ… ADR-0026 amendment
- **Classification:** Patch release (UX refinement, non-breaking)

### v1.1.0 â€” Vector Tool Parity & Composition (Q1 2025)

**Strategic Pivot:** Focus on vector tool expansion and natural composition patterns before deeper reflection domains.

**Goal:** Achieve raster-vector feature parity and explore how models naturally compose operations through tool discovery.

**Vector tool expansion:**
- [ ] `vector_reproject` - CRS transformation for vector datasets
  - Match `raster_reproject` capabilities
  - Reuse `justify_crs_selection` reflection (cross-tool consistency)
- [ ] `vector_convert` - Format conversion (Shapefile â†’ GeoPackage, etc.)
  - Match `raster_convert` pattern
  - Leverage existing compression/format resources
- [ ] `vector_clip` - Spatial subsetting by bounding box or geometry
- [ ] `vector_buffer` - Buffer/proximity analysis
- [ ] `vector_simplify` - Geometry simplification (Douglas-Peucker, Visvalingam)

**Tool composition exploration:**
- [ ] Natural composition testing
  - Can models discover multi-step workflows without explicit prompting?
  - Example: "Prepare data for web display" â†’ reproject + convert + tile
  - Example: "Extract city boundaries" â†’ clip vector + reproject + simplify
- [ ] Composition guidance resources
  - `reference://workflows/common-patterns` - Typical operation sequences
  - Document: raster prep, vector cleaning, format migration patterns
- [ ] Cross-domain operations
  - Vector-raster interaction: clip raster by vector, zonal stats (future)
  - Test if models naturally chain: reproject vector â†’ clip raster â†’ analyze

**Observability for composition:**
- [ ] Session tracking for multi-step workflows
  - Log operation sequences
  - Identify common patterns
  - Measure: Does the model chain tools effectively?

**Deferred to v2.x:**
- Hydrology conditioning (raster_fill_sinks, flow analysis)
- Aggregation tools (raster_zonal_stats with vector zones)
- Deep reflection domains (format selection already covered by resources)
  - `history://operations/{session_id}` - operation log with justifications

### v1.2.0 â€” Semantic Primitives (Q2 2025)

**Goal:** Enable higher-level geospatial reasoning

**Terrain analysis:**
- [ ] `terrain_derivatives` - slope, aspect, hillshade, curvature
  - Reflection: algorithm choice (Horn, Zevenbergen-Thorne), edge handling
- [ ] `viewshed` - visibility analysis from observer points
  - Reflection: Earth curvature, atmospheric refraction parameters

**Classification:**
- [ ] `raster_classify` - threshold-based classification
  - Reflection: threshold selection justification, class boundaries
- [ ] `spectral_indices` - NDVI, NDWI, EVI calculation
  - Reflection: index selection for land cover type

**Discovery resources:**
- [ ] `catalog://workspace/by-crs/{epsg}` - CRS-organized file index
- [ ] `summary://workspace/coverage` - spatial extent union
- [ ] Richer metadata stats in catalog responses

## ðŸ”® Future Vision

### v2.0.0 â€” Full Analysis Suite (Q3 2025)

**Vector analysis:**
- Spatial joins (point-in-polygon, intersects, contains)
- Overlay operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Buffer/clip with distance unit reasoning
- Attribute queries with SQL generation

**Raster analysis:**
- Raster calculator with band math validation
- Zonal statistics with aggregation reflection
- Contour generation with interval selection
- Cost distance and path analysis

**Semantic capabilities:**
- Urban detection from multispectral imagery
- Water body classification with spectral indices
- Land cover change detection workflows
- Automated feature extraction with confidence scores

### Beyond v2.0

**Advanced reasoning:**
- Uncertainty propagation through analysis chains
- Alternative workflow suggestions ("You could also...")
- Quality assessment prompts (check for artifacts, validate ranges)
- Multi-modal reasoning (imagery + vector + terrain)

**Collaboration:**
- Shared justification libraries (team knowledge base)
- Methodology templates for common workflows
- Export justifications to research documentation
